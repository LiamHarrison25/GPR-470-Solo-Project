# GPR-470-Solo-Project concept 1:

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project idea would be to create a marching cube system in Unity with the ability to save and load in levels. I would also want to add the ability for the player to modify the terrain, with the added bonus of including an undo for any terrain modified. 

## Tools & Technologies:
I would like to use Unity Engine to build this project. The reason for using Unity is that I am most familiar with this engine. 

* Langauge: C#

## Scope:
The main feature that I would like to get done for this project would be the marching cubes with the save system. I would also like to get the terrain modification with the undo done as well. If I have time, I would also like to make a full game loop out of it as well. I had attempted marching cubes before but was not able to get as far as I had planned due to me being too busy with other work at the time. This semester, I should have a lot more time to actually complete a full marching cube terrain generation. 

## Deliverables:

* Playable game
* Video showcase


# GPR-470-Solo-Project concept 2:

## Project Objective:

The idea for this project would be based on my work for one of the concepts that my Capstone team had that did not go through. The idea for the concept was to create a game where the player is a collection of self-organizing objects that could reform into different shapes. For this project, it would be cool to create a tool to design what shapes the player can form into. 

## Tools & Technologies:

I would want to do this project in Unity, as the previous work I did on it was also in Unity. 
* Langauge: C#

## Scope:

The main feature that I would want to have in this project would be the ability for the player to change shape with self organizing cells. I would like to design a game around this feature as well with a full game loop. 

## Deliverables:

* Playable game
* Video showcase
