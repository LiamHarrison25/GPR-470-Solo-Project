# Project plan:

## Project Objective:

The idea for this project would be based on my work for one of the concepts that my Capstone team had that did not go through. The idea for the concept was to create a game where the player is a collection of self-organizing objects that could reform into different shapes. For this project, it would be cool to create a tool to design what shapes the player can form into. For the finished product, I would like to get the clumping and organization into different objects working. 

## Tools & Technologies:

I would want to do this project in Unity, as the previous work I did on it was also in Unity. 
* Langauge: C#
* Unity Version: 6000.0.36f1

## Scope:

The main feature that I would want to have in this project would be the ability for the player to change shape with self organizing cells. I would like to design a game around this feature as well with a full game loop. 

## Stretch Goals:

- Marching Cubes: The first stretch goal is to implement a marching cubes procedural terrain system. This would provide an interesting world for the blob to explore.
- Expanding blob based on terrain destruction: With the marching cubes algorithm, it is possible to implement terrain destruction. I want to implement this in a way so that the player can destroy terrain, and consume it. When the player consumes this terrain, they will gain more mass for the blob, and it will gain more entities. 

## Deliverables:

* Playable game
* Video showcase
* Written out section on my portfolio website

## Project Progress:

* Basic grouping completed
* Research into bin packing
* started on formations
* press e to stop the grouping and send the objects into a circle
