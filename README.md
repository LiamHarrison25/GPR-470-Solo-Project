# GPR-470-Solo-Project concept 1:

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project idea would be to create a marching cube system in Unity with the ability to save and load in levels. I would also want to add the ability for the player to modify the terrain, with the added bonus of including an undo for any terrain modified. 

## Tools & Technologies:
I would like to use Unity Engine to build this project. The reason for using Unity is that I am most familiar with this engine. 

* Langauge: C#

## Scope:
The main feature that I would like to get done for this project would be the marching cubes with the save system. I would also like to get te terrain modification with the undo done as well. If I have time, I would also like to make a full game loop out of it as well. I had attempted marching cubes before but was not able to get as far as I had planned due to me being too busy with other work at the time. This semester, I should have a lot more time to actually complete a full marching cube terrain generation. 

## Deliverables:
